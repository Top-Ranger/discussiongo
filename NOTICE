DiscussionGo! - A simple forum software
   created by Marcus Soll (https://msoll.eu)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

DiscussionGo! is my personal forum software.
It was developed with simplicity in mind - both in deployment and architecture.
As such, it might contain certain restrictions in terms of extensibility.
I developed the software with my specific needs in mind. It contains everything I need.
It might not fit your needs. That's ok.
But don't expect me to go out of my way implementing your requests.
I'm releasing the software in the hope that it might be helpful to others.

To run it, simply use the following commands:
go get -u ./...
go build
./discussiongo

The software will create a new user called 'SYSTEM'. You can use it for initial setup.
All configuration can be found in 'config.json' and 'impressum.json'.
All data is saved in 'database.sqlite3' and 'accesstimes.sqlite3'.
